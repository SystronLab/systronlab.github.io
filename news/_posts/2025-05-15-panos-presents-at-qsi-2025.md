At the [Quantum Safe Internet (QSI) Workshop 2025](https://quantum-safeinternet.com/qsi-workshop/) in Copenhagen, a talk on **"Tight Error Correction Performance for CV-QKD in Constrained Storage Devices"** addressed the challenges of deploying CV-QKD on resource-limited platforms such as drones, IoT nodes, and mobile devices.

The presentation introduced a composable key rate framework that incorporates finite-size effects, digitization aspects, and explicit memory modeling. By leveraging non-binary LDPC codes in sparse format, the approach describes near-optimal reconciliation efficiency with memory usage limited to a few megabytes. Simulation results revealed clear trade-offs between key rate, leakage, and storage, providing practical benchmarks for secure system design in short-range quantum networks.
