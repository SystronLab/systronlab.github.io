Dr Poonam Yadav visited the [Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity of Cyber-physical Systems (C3i) Hub](https://c3ihub.org/) at IIT Kanpur, India. Prof. Sandeep Shukla, Project Director of the hub, introdeuced Dr Yadav to the research team and provided a wonderful tour of the lab, discussing solutions being developed -- including different approaches to intrusion detection and cybersecurity in IT and OT systems.

Visiting the lab also provided an opportunity to see the incresible facilities available, some of which we hope to replicate within the Systron Lab, complementing our work on IoT devices and 6G systems.
