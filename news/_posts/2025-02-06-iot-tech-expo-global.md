Dr Poonam Yadav, SYSTRON Lab lead, was recently invited to participate on two panels speaking at the [IoT Tech Expo World Series 2025](https://www.iottechexpo.com/global/) held at Olympia, London. The event brought together industry leaders, innovators, and visionaries to discuss the future of connectivity and the evolving landscape of IoT cybersecurity.

## Panel 1: The Future of Connectivity (5th Feb)

Moderated by Joe Barrett, President of GSA, along with esteemed panelists Andy Fidler (BT Group) and Ben Timmons (Qualcomm Technologies Inc.), we explored:

* The Role of Emerging Technologies: The transformative potential of 5G, satellite communications, and low-power networks in driving IoT innovations.
* Scaling Challenges: Navigating the complexities of expanding IoT networks while ensuring reliability and efficiency.
* Security in a Hyper-Connected World: Addressing the critical need for robust security protocols as connectivity becomes ubiquitous.
* Adaptability and Support of 3GPP RedCap NR: The discussion highlighted how this feature streamlines UE design by minimising the number of RX/TX antennas, reducing bandwidth consumption, lowering power requirements, and relaxing demands on data rates, processing time, and computational capabilities. This optimised design enables a variety of promising use cases, especially in industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance, and wearable technologies.

**Key takeaway: Connectivity is more than just speed - itâ€™s about resilience, security, and adaptability across industries.**

## Panel 2: Transforming IoT Cybersecurity in 2025 and Beyond (6th Feb)

Moderated by Kuba Smolorz (STL Partners), I had the pleasure of discussing IoT cybersecurity with Peter Allwood (Mastercard), Zahra Khani (Keysight Technologies), and Suyash J. (InfluxData).

Highlights included:

* Emerging Threats: The evolving sophistication of cyberattacks and the implications for IoT devices and importance of firmware security and security and privacy by design.
* AI and Machine Learning: How these technologies are reshaping security strategies, from predictive threat modelling to real-time anomaly detection.
* Data Privacy & Compliance: Navigating the fine line between innovation, standardisations and regulatory requirements in a data-driven world.

**Key takeaway: As IoT expands, cybersecurity must evolve from reactive measures to proactive, intelligent defense mechanisms.**
