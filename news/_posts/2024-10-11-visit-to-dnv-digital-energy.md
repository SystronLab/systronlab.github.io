Dr Poonam Yadav joined members of the University of York's [Centre for Assuring Autonomy](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/) in visiting the [DNV Research and Testing Facility at Spadeadam](https://www.dnv.com/energy/services/laboratories-test-facilities/spadeadam/) in Cumbria, UK.

Hosted by Graham Faiz and the DNV team, the visit was incredibly insightful - discussing safe and ethical AI and autonomous systems, and the work DNV do to de-risk energy transition.
