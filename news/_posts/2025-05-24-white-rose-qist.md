At the White Rose QIST Meeting held on 23rd May 2025, at the Bragg Building, University of Leeds, a talk was presented by Panos Papanastasiou on **"Error-Correction Encoding Storage for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution in Constrained Devices."**

The presentation focused on the critical role of finite-size effects in the design of secure CV-QKD protocols for platforms with tight size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints, such as IoT sensors, drones, and mobile quantum nodes. Emphasizing the statistical mismatch between observed data and ideal distributions, the work introduced a composable key rate formula that incorporates finite-size penalties, leakage bounds, and storage requirements based on non-binary LDPC codes. The framework provides accurate benchmarks for real-world performance, revealing trade-offs between reconciliation efficiency, memory usage, and key rateâ€”guiding the development of lightweight, secure QKD systems under realistic resource limitations.
