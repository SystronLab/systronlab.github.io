Even minor changes to Internet routing protocols or their configurations can result in severe disruptions to the stability and security of global Internet routing. However, current test environments remain limited in scope and fail to reflect the true complexity and scale of the Internet. This highlights the urgent need for a high-fidelity Internet Digital Twin - a large-scale, emulated environment that can safely replicate and experiment with real-world Internet conditions. In this extended abstract, we present our approach to building such an Internet-scale digital twin for internetwork routing protocols. By capturing the current state of Internet topology, we generate a virtual testbed using a container orchestration framework, with each container simulating an ISP-level network. This infrastructure enables rigorous testing and enhancement of Internet routing protocols under realistic conditions. Looking ahead, our vision is to scale these emulations further to encompass the entire observable Internet, establishing the digital twin as a critical tool for future Internet resilience and innovation.
