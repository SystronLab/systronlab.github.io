In the contemporary digital society, a critical problem can be highlighted: individuals lack granular control over their personal data. Despite current legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Governance Act, the Data Act, and the AI Act, these frameworks frequently fall short of empowering data generators - those who create data - to control how this data that refers to them is used. 

This project proposes a novel framework to enhance data sharing by redefining data control and shifting ownership from data provider entities to data generators

## Objectives

1. Define mechanisms to enable data federation
2. Define mechanisms for efficient data annotation and classification
3. Define data governance policies
4. Guarantee trust

To better understand the objectives, as well as the project overall, please have a look at the publications below.
