The SYSTRON Lab is based in the Ian Wand Building, Campus East, at the University of York. We also have a presence in the nearby Institute for Safe Autonomy (ISA) and in City College, Thessaloniki - the University of York's Europe Campus.

## Locations

### The Ian Wand Building

Located on University of York Campus East, the Ian Wand Building is the home of the University of York's Computer Science Department. We have offices in this space, as well as a specialist research lab.

### Institute for Safe Autonomy (ISA)

Also located on Campus East, the ISA building is a new Â£15m purpose-built facility with experimental laboratories for robotics, advanced communications and quantum technologies, including separate networks for robotic and autonomous systems.

This also has a number of [test spaces](https://www.york.ac.uk/safe-autonomy/facilities/laboratories-and-test-spaces/).


## Research Testbeds

As part of our research, we have constructed a small number of testbeds.

### Thread Edge Testbed

As [presented earlier this year at the NDSS Symposium](/publications/2025-evaluation-of-radio-jamming-countermeasures), we have a dedicated testbed for IoT-based radio networks which we have used for experiments around Thread-based (IEEE 802.15.4) networking.
