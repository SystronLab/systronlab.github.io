The Department of Computer Science at the University of York invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate position based in SystronLab, funded by two UKRI EPSRC projects: **CHEDDAR** (Communications Hub for Empowering Distributed Cloud Computing Applications and Research) and **REMOTE** (Resilient and Secure Multi-Access Interoperable Communication Fabric for TinyEdge).

The CHEDDAR Hub is designed to drive forward research in distributed cloud computing applications while fostering bold and innovative ideas in communications and networking. Its mission is to connect centres of UK excellence, stimulate collaboration, and ensure the UK continues to lead globally in 6G technologies. This position offers an exciting opportunity to contribute to a national network of hubs - working alongside initiatives such as Titan and HASC - to generate world-class research and secure future project and platform funding.

The REMOTE project focuses on developing an open-source communication framework tailored for diverse IoT applications. The framework will provide seamless connectivity while meeting requirements around data rates, latency, security, energy efficiency, resilience, data privacy, and reliability. The project will culminate in two small-scale use case studies, assessing the architecture’s effectiveness against various quality-of-service (QoS) and security benchmarks.

## Department

The Department of Computer Science at York is internationally recognised for excellence in teaching, research, and industry engagement. Its strong reputation is reflected in recent achievements, including 11th place in the UK for research quality (REF 2021) and 12th in the Complete University Guide 2023.

At the department, equality, diversity, and inclusion are central to our culture and we strive to provide a working environment which allows all staff and students to contribute fully, to flourish, and to excel. We aim to ensure that there is a supportive and egalitarian culture at all levels and offer a range of family-friendly, inclusive employment policies, flexible working arrangements, staff engagement forums, campus facilities and services to support staff from different backgrounds. The School is proud to hold Juno Champion, and Athena Swan awards.

## Role

The Postdoctoral Research Associate will play a key role in advancing research in cyber security, privacy, networking, and wireless systems as part of the EPSRC-funded CHEDDAR and REMOTE projects. The role involves conducting high-quality independent and collaborative research, developing novel methodologies, and contributing to cutting-edge solutions in secure and resilient communication systems.

The postholder will also support the preparation of publications in leading venues (e.g., PETS, NDSS, NSDI, IEEE S&P, CCS), contribute to securing research funding, and engage with the wider research community through conferences, workshops, and outreach. In addition, the postholder will contribute to mentoring postgraduate students and building collaborations across academia, industry, and standardisation bodies.

## Skills, Experience & Qualification needed

* First degree in Computer Science or similar field.
* PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience.
* Knowledge of a range of research techniques and methodologies.
* Strong research and problem-solving skills in cyber-security, privacy, and computer networking.
